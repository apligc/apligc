<h1>Sideline Story</h1>


<p><font size="4">
Apligc (uh-plig-see) strives to be more than just <i>technicians</i> that fix your computer. We care about the environment, which fuels us to create <i>innovative</i> ways to reduce e-waste. We also care about YOU! So during our process of fixing and recycling computers we'll <i>educate</i> you on ways you can properly recycle your old electronics, how to use your computers, navigate through the newest Windows operating systems and how to use other devices!
